Tab Notifier
==================

A user style which highlights any open Gmail, Google Reader, Google Voice, and Facebook tab when there are unread items. Works best with the [FaviconizeTab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3780) for Firefox.

- Gmail tabs are highlighted red when the inbox is open and there are unread items.
- Gmail tabs will flash green when a new chat message is received.
- Google Reader tabs are highlighted light blue when there are unread items.
- Google Voice tabs are highlighted yellow when the inbox is open and there are unread items (either calls or SMS)
- Facebook tabs are highlighted blue when there is an unread notification item.
